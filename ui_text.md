## Demo Flow Narrative

**Part 1: Problem Identification**
"Here in our Downtown District, temperatures reach 42.5°C, driving up cooling demand. Simultaneously, our agricultural zone requires 800,000 liters daily, often wasted through inefficient irrigation."

**Part 2: UWHIS Activation**
"When we activate UWHIS, AI predicts these demands 24 hours ahead. It allocates water efficiently while scheduling cooling interventions during peak solar availability."

**Part 3: Results Display**
"Notice the transformation: Water usage drops by 30%, cooling energy reduces by 20%, and we save AED 16,500 daily while lowering urban temperatures by 6°C."

## Call to Action
"Join us in building sustainable cities. UWHIS demonstrates how AI can create resilient urban ecosystems that thrive in challenging environments."
